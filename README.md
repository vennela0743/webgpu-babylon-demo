# Babylon WebGPU Demo

An interactive architectural viewer built with **Babylon.js**, **React**, and **WebGPU**.  
It renders the Wells Fargo tower and the Alsop bridge, lets you rotate/pan/zoom with smooth camera controls, and includes model highlighting plus a minimal HUD.

> **WebGPU requirement**: run on Chrome/Edge ≥121 (or Safari ≥17.4). The dev server and production builds send the required COOP/COEP headers so you do **not** need to enable the “Unsafe WebGPU” flag.

---

## Features
- Pure WebGPU rendering via Babylon’s `WebGPUEngine`
- Automatic model loading and scaling from `public/assets/*.glb`
- Smooth camera controls with click-to-focus and snap-to-grid options
- Outline-based hover highlighting (fallback when highlight shaders aren’t available)
- Zustand store powering the control panel (quality, snap distance, selected model)
- Ready for Vercel deployment with `npm run build`

## Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/App.tsx` | Mounts the canvas (`CanvasHost`) and overlay UI (`ControlsPanel`). |
| `src/components/CanvasHost.tsx` | Sets up the WebGPU engine, camera, lights; loads models; wires pointer interactions. |
| `src/core/SceneManager.ts` | Alt. scene manager used by utilities/tests (kept for reference). |
| `src/core/sceneControls.ts` | Camera helpers (`focusModel`, `resetView`, `toggleWireframe`). |
| `src/core/models.config.ts` | Declarative list of GLB models (file name, position, fit size, rotation). |
| `src/state/store.ts` | Zustand store for UI state (quality, snap meters, engine badge, etc.). |
| `public/assets` | The GLB files that are loaded at runtime. |

## Key Functions & Hooks

### `initScene(canvas)` – `CanvasHost.tsx`
1. Checks `navigator.gpu`, creates a `WebGPUEngine`, and configures Babylon scene + lights.
2. Tunes the `ArcRotateCamera` (wheel, pan, rotation sensitivities).
3. Creates the highlight/outline infrastructure and registers resize + pointer listeners.
4. Calls `loadModels(scene, MODELS, camera, highlightLayer, anchors)` to bring in GLBs.

### `loadModels(...)`
- Loads each GLB via `LoadAssetContainerAsync`.
- Computes bounds to auto-scale and center each model around its anchor.
- Repairs UVs only if missing/invalid (fixes the bridge appearance).
- Registers hover/pick actions that interact with the highlight fallback and `focusModel`.

### `sceneControls.ts`
- `focusModel(name)` animates the camera to the model’s bounds.
- `resetView()` resets the orbit view.
- `toggleWireframe(enabled)` toggles wireframe on every mesh.

### Zustand actions (`src/state/store.ts`)
- `setQuality`, `setWater`, `setSnap`, `setSelected`, `setWireframe`, `setEngineType`.
These keep React UI state synchronized with camera tweaks inside Babylon.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Run dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# 3. Build production bundle
npm run build

# 4. Preview the built bundle with the same headers as prod
npm run preview
```

### Node version
Use Node 20+ . Earlier versions may lack WebGPU polyfills.

### Cross-Origin Isolation
`vite.config.ts` injects the headers below for both `dev` and `preview` so WebGPU works without Chrome flags:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

If you switch to another HTTP server (nginx, S3, etc.) ensure these two headers are set.

## Deployment (Vercel example)

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, **Import Project → GitHub → this repo**.
3. Framework preset: `Vite` (detected automatically).  
   Build command: `npm run build` · Output dir: `dist`.
4. Leave “Root Directory” empty (project lives at repo root).
5. Deploy – Vercel builds and serves `dist/` with the correct headers.

You can also serve `dist/` from any static host (Netlify, Cloudflare, nginx) as long as you keep the COOP/COEP headers.

## Controls Cheat Sheet

| Action | Input |
| --- | --- |
| Orbit | Left mouse drag |
| Pan | Right mouse drag |
| Zoom | Scroll wheel |
| Focus model | Click a model (anchor animates camera) |

Happy hacking! Feel free to extend `MODELS` with additional GLBs or hook into the store for richer UI controls. If you deploy publicly, share the URL! 🚀
